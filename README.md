my ai test.\
under construction, expect a requirments.txt and a guide of how to run the AI soon.\
I used the model on the mnist dataset and achived 93.4 train accuracy (94.7 test accuracy), with 11935 paramaters and a custom activation function I developed.\
My own ANN model developed from scratch without the use of any AI Libaries (only numpy + matplotlib are used). 
Includes a custom implementation of the backpropagation algorithm, an efficient method for computing the gradient of a cost function to optimize neural network performance by minimizing errors.\
The ai.ipynb file is the one containing the working ANN.\
The program is quite modular, allowing me to edit the ANN to be as big or as small as I want it to be.
