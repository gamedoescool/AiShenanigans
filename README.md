my ai test.\
under construction, expect a requirments.txt and a guide of how to run the AI soon.\
I used the model on the mnist dataset and achived 91 percent test accuracy, with 11935 paramaters and a custom activation function.\
My own ANN model developed from scratch without the use of any AI Libaries (only numpy + matplotlib are used). Includes a custom backpropagation algorithm that I made.\
The ai.ipynb file is the one containing the working ANN.\
The program is quite modoular, allowing me to edit the ANN to be as big or as small as I want it to be.
