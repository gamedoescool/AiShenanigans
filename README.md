my ai test 
under construction, expect a requirments.txt and a guide of how to run the AI soon.
I used the model on the mnist dataset and achived 91 percent test accuracy, with 11935 paramaters and a custom activation function.
the ai.ipynb file is the one containing the working ANN.
The program is quite modoular, allowing me to edit the ANN to be as big or as small as I want it to be.
